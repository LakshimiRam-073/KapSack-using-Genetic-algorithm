## Genetic Algorithm for Knapsack problem

Every Problem has a solution, But the solution is may or may not optimal to the problem. Many algos used to find the answer but may not be the optimal one or fall in the local optima

But Genetic algorithm used to find out the all the possible answers(chromosomes) that can be formed towards the optimizated selection of the previous solutions that is formed.

__Knapsack__: This problem contains a certain number of products with it's weight and it's values. We have to find the most optimal solution to fill a bag of certain weight with higher value.

Using Gen algo I used to solve the hundred years old problem Knapsack.
With various functions such as crossover,fitness,validation,mutation,selection to create generations of chromosomes(answers for a local optima) with a specific number of population.
It works in the principle of __Darwin's Natural Selection__.
